Description: Performs biomedical named entity recognition,
    Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) concept mapping, and negation
    detection using the Python 'spaCy', 'scispaCy', and 'medspaCy' packages, and 
    transforms extracted data into a wide format for inclusion in machine
    learning models. The development of the 'scispaCy' package is described by
    Neumann (2019) <doi:10.18653/v1/W19-5034>. The 'medspacy' package uses
    'ConText', an algorithm for determining the context of clinical statements
    described by Harkema (2009) <doi:10.1016/j.jbi.2009.05.002>. Clinspacy
    also supports entity embeddings from 'scispaCy' and UMLS 'cui2vec' concept
    embeddings developed by Beam (2018) <arXiv:1804.01486>.
